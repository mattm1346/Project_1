                <h2>sukhansana</h2>
                <p>This is a grounding pose that you can use when meditating, relaxing and practicing your breathing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sit on an even surface (floor) and cross your shins over one another. Relax your shoulders and sit up straight.</p>
                <br>    
                <p>Take long deep breaths in through your nose and out your mouth.</p>
                <br>    
                <p>If your having any difficulty maintaining your posture, elevate your hips by sitting on a blanket or pillow.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>seated twist</h2>
                <p>This pose is believed to stimulate the digestive system and remove any toxins in your body.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To begin, sit in the SUKHANSANA pose. Move your right behind your right hip and your left hand to your right knee. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Take a deep breath and as you breathe out twist a little to the right using your hands as anchor points. Hold for five breaths and repeat on the other side.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If having trouble, place a yoga block or a book under your right hand so your spine will stay in a more upright position.</p>
                <br>

                <img src="assets/images/sphinx.jpg" alt="A woman in the sphinx position" id="technique-images-wide">
                <h2>sphinx</h2>
                <p>This is a gentle pose that bends your back and opens your chest. It is said to lengthen the front side of your body.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Lie on your stomach, place your elbows either side of your chest. Take a deep breath and slowly push your elbows and raise your chest above the ground.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As you push, exhale and bring your head as far back as you can. Do this for five breaths.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As you get better, you can extend this pose by moving your hands by your side so your spine stretches a little further.</p>
                <br>

            <div class="techniques">
                <img src="assets/images/child's_pose.jpg" alt="A woman in the child's pose position" id="technique-images-wide">
                <h2>child's pose</h2>
                <p>This is another resting pose like the SUKHANSANA. It is ideal to do straight after the SPHINX pose as it gives your spine a little break while maintaining a level pose.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Start on your hands and knees, then move your knees apart so they are a little further than your hips and bring your feet together.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Walk your hands forward so your stomach rests between your thighs. Bring your forehead to the ground and keep walking your hands so your arms are out in front. Maintain this pose for five breathes.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If your heels hurt from sitting on them, place a blanket or pillow over them.</p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <div class="techniques">
                <img src="assets/images/down_dog.jpg" alt="A woman in the down dog position" id="technique-images-wide">
                <h2>down dog</h2>
                <p>This pose is great for the lower body, particularly the calves.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Begin on your hands and knees. Make sure your hands are shoulder width apart and your knees are in line with your hips. Tuck your toes under and lift so your bottom is high and legs straight.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As your lifting, your arms should become straight and your head and neck should be level with your arms. Effectively, your body should look like a "V".</p>
                <br>
                <p>If your heels don't touch the ground don't worry too much, just make sure that you can feel your calves stretching. If not, move your feet forwards a little.</p>
