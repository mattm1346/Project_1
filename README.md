*User Experience*

Target audience

The target audience for Yogasstick are beginners to yoga who wish to learn more about yoga, and experienced people to yoga who wish to book a class.

The website is clearly displayed in order to make it as easy as possible to navigate through each page. Therefore, users of all ages and technological skill will be able to use the website with no difficulty.

Beginners to yoga will want to learn the techniques to yoga which Yogasstick has a dedicated page to do just that. Beginners may also wish to join a yoga class in order to learn in a classroom environment and to build relationships with other members. Yogasstick has a booking page where users can see what time and day is suitable for them and a details page where they can book their place for a lesson.

All users will want to practice yoga in a safe environment. Yogasstick therefore offers the opportunity to practice yoga in their home via the techniques page. Should users wish to book a class, there is a capacity limit which is displayed on the bookings page. This is to ensure the safety of all members by allowing everyone to social distance while the covid-19 pandemic continues.

*Wireframes*

Using the software, 'Balsamiq Wireframes' I created a very basic structure to how I initially wanted Yogasstick to look.

![tips](https://github.com/mattm1346/Project_1/blob/master/assets/screenshots/wireframe%20tips.jpg.png)

I originally called the 'Schedule' page the 'Tips' page. With the 'Tips' page I planned to involve some helpful advice to help with yoga and wellness. But I decided to delete the 'Tips' page in favor of the 'Schedule' page and include tips in the 'Techniques' page.

![contact](https://github.com/mattm1346/Project_1/blob/master/assets/screenshots/wireframe%20contact.jpg.png)

The 'Booking' page started as the 'Contact' page and included a class timesheet of the classes and the ability to book. There's also a map embeded to allow for the user to locate the studio where classes are held.

*Features*

*Homepage (Index.html)*

The homepage is the face of the site and first introduces the user to Yogasstick. It includes a hero image of a woman doing yoga by a lake which draws the user's eye while also encapturing what the website is about, yoga.

*Techniques (Techniques.html)*

The techniques page is where the main information of yoga is held. There are five beginner level techniques each in their own division, with a description of the technique and an image to accompany and further explain what the user should be doing.

*Schedule (Schedule.html)*

The schedule page is all about getting the user to book a class. Here we start with a full list of times that the studio will be holding classes for yoga. Under this, there is a disclaimer notifying the user that class availability is limited due to the coronavirus pandemic (although this website is completely fiction, I thought it would be a good idea to show how it can adapt to changing social times).

There is also a map embeded from google maps (https://www.google.co.uk/maps/). The studio location is shown on the map which is interactive. This is to help users find the location of the studio.

*Booking (Details.html)*

The booking page is where the user can book their class. It has a functioning form that requires the user's; first name, last name, email address and what time and date they would like to book. 

Under the form, there are three icons from Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/) reminding the user to stay safe. In the coronavirus pandemic, the three main rules to stay safe were to: wash hands, wear a face mask, and keep a two meter distance from others. The icons on the website include a short description to remind the user to keep themselves and each other safe.

*Nav-bar*

On each page, there is a navigation bar with links to each page to allow for easy navigation.
