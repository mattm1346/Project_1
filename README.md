*Wireframes*

Using the software, 'Balsamiq Wireframes' I created a very basic structure to how I initially wanted Yogasstick to look.

I originally called the 'Schedule' page the 'Tips' page. With the 'Tips' page I planned to involve some helpful advice to help with yoga and wellness. But I decided to delete the 'Tips' page in favor of the 'Schedule' page and include tips in the 'Techniques' page.

The 'Booking' page started as the 'Contact' page and included a class timesheet of the classes and the ability to book. There's also a map embeded to allow for the user to locate the studio where classes are held.
